## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

library(class)

# Setting seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Preprocessing the data
x <- scale(iris[,c(1,2)])
y <- iris$Species
n <- nrow(iris)
k <- 7

# Defining percentages of data to be used for training
percentages <- seq(from=0.2, to=0.8, by=0.2)
ntrials <- 20
accuracies <- matrix(0, nrow=ntrials, ncol=length(percentages))

# Performing KNN classification for each percentage
for (p in 1:length(percentages)) {
    ntrain <- as.integer(n*percentages[p])
    for (ntry in 1:ntrials) {
        train <- sample(1:n, ntrain)
        kpred <- knn(train=x[train,], test=x[-train,], cl=y[train], k=k)
        accuracies[ntry, p] <- sum(y[-train]==kpred)/(n-ntrain)
    }
}

mean_accuracies <- colMeans(accuracies)

for (p in 1:length(percentages)) {
    cat(sprintf("Mean accuracy for %0.0f%% training data: %0.2f%%\n", percentages[p]*100, mean_accuracies[p]*100))
}

# Visualization using ggplot2 (optional)
if (require(ggplot2)) {
    df <- data.frame(Percentage = percentages * 100, Accuracy = mean_accuracies * 100)
    ggplot(df, aes(x = Percentage, y = Accuracy)) +
        geom_line(group=1) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(title = "KNN Classification Accuracy vs Training Data Percentage", 
             x = "Percentage of Training Data", 
             y = "Mean Accuracy (%)") +
        theme_minimal()
}
